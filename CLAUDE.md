# Ticker

macOS research app: Swift backend + React/TipTap frontend in WKWebView + global Quick Panel.

## CRITICAL: Working Practices

**These rules override default behavior. Follow them exactly.**

### Before Any Implementation

1. **Restate the requirement in your own words** and get explicit confirmation before writing code
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if there is ANY ambiguity about what is being requested
3. **Distinguish between** what the user said vs what you interpreted vs what you assume
4. **If a task seems straightforward, be MORE suspicious** — that's when misunderstandings happen

### During Implementation

1. **Work in small, verifiable increments** — commit and test frequently
2. **Stop and ask** if scope expands or you encounter unexpected complexity
3. **Do not "improve" or add features** beyond what was explicitly requested
4. **If you're uncertain, say so** — don't paper over uncertainty with code

### After Implementation

1. **Describe what you built** in plain terms — does it match what was asked?
2. **Identify what you did NOT implement** — make omissions explicit
3. **Ask the user to verify** before moving on

### Collaboration with GPT-5.2

For non-trivial work:
- Ask GPT-5.2 for blast radius analysis and edge cases BEFORE starting
- Ask GPT-5.2 to review diffs AFTER each change
- If GPT-5.2 flags a concern, address it before continuing

### Commit Approval Workflow

**DO NOT COMMIT until GPT approves the change.**

After completing a slice/task, provide a comprehensive summary that includes:

1. **What was built** — Files created/modified, their purpose, key implementation details
2. **Schema/architecture decisions** — Any structural choices and why
3. **What was NOT built** — Explicit list of deferred functionality
4. **How it integrates** — How new code connects to existing systems
5. **Testing instructions** — How to verify the change works
6. **Risks/concerns** — Anything that might break or needs attention
7. **Code snippets** — Key code sections for review (not just file names)

The user will share this summary with GPT for review. Only commit after approval.

## Quick Reference

### Build & Run

```bash
# Preferred: Use tickerctl.sh for all build operations
./tickerctl.sh              # Interactive menu
./tickerctl.sh build-dev    # Build Debug (unsigned)
./tickerctl.sh run-dev      # Build + run Debug with Vite dev server
./tickerctl.sh build-prod   # Build Release (unsigned, bundles web)
./tickerctl.sh run-prod     # Build + run Release (bundled web)

# Direct xcodebuild (if needed)
xcodebuild build -project Ticker.xcodeproj -scheme Ticker -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .build/xcode

# Web typecheck only
cd Web && npm run typecheck
```

**Never run the app directly** — only build. User runs to avoid orphaned processes.

### Release (Alpha Channel)

```bash
# Full release: build → sign → notarize → zip → Sparkle-sign → publish → appcast
./tickerctl.sh release-alpha --version 2025.12.1 --promote

# Or step by step via menu option 5/6
./tickerctl.sh
```

Requires `tickerctl.local.sh` with signing credentials (see `tickerctl.local.example.sh`).

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Stale Swift Package Manager Data

**Symptom:** Build fails with "XCFramework not found" errors pointing to old paths.

**Fix:**
```bash
rm -rf .build/xcode
# Then rebuild — SPM will re-resolve packages
```

### CORS Errors in Release Build

**Symptom:** WebView console shows "Origin null is not allowed" or "Not allowed to load local resource".

**Cause:** `file://` URLs have null origin; ES modules require CORS.

**Fix:** Web content is served via `ticker-bundle://` custom URL scheme (not `file://`). If errors persist, verify:
1. `BundleSchemeHandler.swift` is registered in `WebViewManager.init()`
2. Release mode loads `ticker-bundle:///index.html` (not `loadFileURL`)
3. Vite config removes `crossorigin` attributes from build output

### iCloud Workspace Errors

**Symptom:** Codesign fails with "resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed".

**Fix:** Move repo out of iCloud Drive (preferred) or use `-derivedDataPath /tmp/ticker-xcode-build`.

### Build Number

For release builds, set `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION=$(git rev-list --count HEAD)` for monotonic build numbers. CI and `tickerctl.sh` do this automatically.

### Data Locations

All user data lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Ticker/`:
- `ticker.db` — SQLite database (GRDB)
- `assets/` — User images (screenshots, pastes)
- `backups/` — Auto-created before migrations (keeps 5 newest)

## Data Model

- **Stream**: Research session with cells and source references
- **Cell**: Content block (`text`, `aiResponse`, `quote`)
  - `modifiers`: Transformation chain (e.g., "make shorter")
  - `originalPrompt`: User's input (for AI response cells)
  - `sourceApp`: Origin app name (for quote cells from Quick Panel)
  - `processingConfig`: Live block settings (refresh triggers)
- **SourceReference**: Attached file with extracted text, embeddings

---

## Editor Architecture

The app uses a **unified editor** — a single TipTap instance for the entire stream:

- **Schema**: `doc -> cellBlock+`, where `cellBlock -> block+` (rich content)
- **Cross-cell selection**: Native ProseMirror selection spans multiple cells
- **Cell identity**: UUID-based (`data-cell-id` attribute), never positional
- **Data flow**: TipTap → Store → Persistence (one direction during editing)
- **External updates** (AI complete, Quick Panel): Write TO TipTap, then normal flow resumes

Legacy editor remains available via Settings toggle or `?unified=false` URL param.

---

## Quick Panel

Global capture panel accessible via **Cmd+L** from any app. Captures selected text, screenshots, and notes.

**Hotkeys:**
- `Cmd+L` — Toggle Quick Panel (captures selection before opening)
- `Cmd+;` — Screenshot mode (triggers screencapture, then opens panel)

**Input Modes:**
| Context | Action | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Selection + ENTER | Capture | Quote cell with sourceApp |
| Selection + text + ENTER | Capture + note | Quote + text cells |
| Selection + text + CMD+ENTER | Capture + AI | Quote + AI response |
| Text only + ENTER | Note | Text cell |
| Text only + CMD+ENTER | AI query | AI response cell |

**Stream Targeting:**
- Default: Most recently modified stream
- After 15min idle: Show stream picker
- No streams: Create "Untitled"

---

## Sparkle (Auto-Updates)

Integrated via Sparkle 2.6.0+ (Swift Package Manager).

- **Appcast URL**: `https://nikokozak.github.io/Streams/appcast-alpha.xml`
- **EdDSA public key**: Stored in `Info.plist` (`SUPublicEDKey`)
- **Private key**: Stored in macOS Keychain (for signing updates)
- **Menu item**: "Check for Updates..." triggers `SPUStandardUpdaterController`

Update signing handled by `tickerctl.sh release-alpha` using Sparkle's `sign_update` tool.

---

## Code Standards

1. Delete over patch — no hacks
2. No dead code
3. No force unwraps in Swift (use `guard`, `if let`, `??`)
4. No `any` types in TypeScript
5. `async/await` for async code
6. Data in `~/Library/Application Support/Ticker/` — never ad-hoc locations

---

## Versioning

- **Marketing version**: `YYYY.MM.patch` (e.g., `2025.12.1`)
- **Build number**: `git rev-list --count HEAD` (monotonic)
- **Bundle ID**: `io.ticker.app`

## Adding New Swift Files

When creating new `.swift` files, they must be added to `Ticker.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` in 4 places:

1. **PBXBuildFile section** — `A... /* File.swift in Sources */`
2. **PBXFileReference section** — `B... /* File.swift */`
3. **PBXGroup children** — Add to appropriate group (App, Services, Models, etc.)
4. **PBXSourcesBuildPhase files** — Add build file reference

Use existing entries as templates. IDs must be unique (continue hex sequence).

## Strategic Guidance

When discussing product direction: challenge assumptions, name tradeoffs, ground opinions in evidence. Distinguish "exciting" from "valuable." Be concrete about feasibility. The goal is collaborative rigor.
