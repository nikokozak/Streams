# Website Requirements (Alpha)

Purpose: onboard testers, set expectations, and provide a support path.

## Pages

### `/` Landing
- What Ticker is
- Screenshots/GIF
- “Join waitlist” form

### `/alpha`
- Alpha expectations: bugs, possible data loss, no uptime guarantees
- Update policy (Sparkle auto-updates)
- How to report bugs (in-app)

### `/privacy`
- What diagnostics are collected (link to `docs/PRIVACY_DIAGNOSTICS.md` concepts)
- Retention: raw logs max 30 days
- Clear statement that note corpus is not collected by default

### `/status`
- Proxy status (manual update acceptable v1)

### `/contact`
- Email/contact form

## Waitlist + issuance (manual)

Flow:
1) user submits email
2) admin approves
3) system issues a **device key**
4) email instructions: paste key into Settings → Validate

## Notes

- Keep copy honest and specific (alpha, diagnostics default-on with opt-out).
- Provide clear “what to do when AI is down” guidance.
